# MEB_PHYSIC9710

Hello ! 
This repository contains the project, report, data files and code for the Mespspheric Energy Budget project by Kasia Wisniewski and Nick Buccongello. There are two code file types: the typical `.py` file and the `.ipynb` so which is the Google Colab note book. Chose which ever you'd like to explore. 

The report contains more details then the prentation so if your interested in learning more, check it out!
Added is the original presentation as well. 

`for026.txt` is a data set sent from Dr. Martin Mlynzcak of SABER data. For more SABER data to explore, check out `http://saber.gats-inc.com/browse_data.php`

For the code:
- if you can find a potential conversion error as mentioned in the presentation you will earn a prize: my sincerest admiration. Also i'll buy you lunch. 
- Some fun things to explore could be the different absorbtion bands like:
    - Hartley band 203 - 305 nm for O3
    - Huggins band 305 - 397 nm for O3
    - Chappuis band 397 - 850 nm for O3
    - Schumann-Runge continuum 130- 175 nm for O2
    - Schumann-Runge bands 175 -200 nm for O2
    - Herzberg continuum 200 - 240 nm for O2
    - Lyman a 121.5 nm for O2
    - Atmospheric band 762 nm for O2
